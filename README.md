# asthma-subtypes

This repo contains the code to implement the analysis framework described in [this paper](). 
Access to [OPCRD](https://opcrd.co.uk) would be required to replicate the main analysis and internal validation, and access to the [SAIL Databank](https://saildatabank.com) to replicate the external validation.
The framework could be extended to other datastes comprising categorical input features.

# repo guide
- The code (R & SQL) used to derived the datasets from OPCRD can be found in [analysis/cohort_opcrd/main]().
- The Read code lists used to define clinical features can be found in [analysis/read_codes]().
- The code (R) used to implement the analysis framework to identify asthma subtypes can be found in [analysis/identify_subtypes](). 
- The TeX files for the [supplementary material]() can be found in [manuscript]().
